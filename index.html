Each point represents a hotspot, with colour intensity indicating the level of surface heat. Users can adjust the Minimum Confidence (%) and Minimum Brightness controls to filter out weak or uncertain detections, refining the visualisation to highlight only significant fire events.
The 2016 Tasmanian fires burned over 100,000 hectares, including parts of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, while subsequent years saw widespread fires driven by drought and high fuel loads. The 2019–2020 Black Summer fires were among the most destructive in recorded history, burning nearly 24 million hectares, destroying over 3,000 homes, and killing or displacing an estimated three billion animals. In the following years, bushfires continued at a smaller scale, including events in New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania during the 2021–2022 season.
