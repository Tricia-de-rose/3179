  Exploring how human activity, emissions, and climate change amplify ignition risks —
  revealing the environmental and anthropogenic pressures that set the stage for Australia’s fires.

            <p class="chart-caption">
              Most bushfires in Australia stem from human activity rather than natural events. 
              While lightning remains a key natural cause, deliberate ignitions, escaped agricultural burns, and recreational fires account for the majority of incidents. 
              Up to two-thirds of Australian bushfires are human-related, often occurring near populated and farming areas. 
              These findings emphasize how human behaviour amplifies natural fire risks, making prevention and awareness vital in reducing ignition sources. 
              Data shows that lightning causes about 22% of fires and drought around 10%. 
              In contrast, human factors such as deliberate acts, agricultural burns, campfires, cigarettes, and machinery account for over 60% of bushfire ignitions across Australia.

            <div id="risingco2"></div>
            <p class="chart-caption">
              Australia’s per-capita CO₂ emissions climbed sharply from around 6.8 tonnes in 1950 to a peak of over 19 tonnes by the early 2000s, before gradually declining to 14.5 tonnes in 2023. 
              This long-term accumulation of greenhouse gases, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, has contributed to Australia’s warming trend with hotter and drier conditions creating the ideal environment for bushfires. 
              The close link between increasing emissions and temperature anomalies underscores how decades of industrial and energy-driven growth have intensified the nation’s bushfire risk through a steadily warming atmosphere. 
              CO₂ emissions are measured in metric tonnes, representing the amount of carbon dioxide released per person each year.

            <div id="emissionsbarchart"></div>
            <p class="chart-caption">
              Greenhouse gas emissions across Australian states vary widely by source and economic activity.
              In 2023, Queensland and New South Wales recorded the highest totals, largely driven by the
              energy and industrial sectors. Agriculture and land use changes also remain significant emitters
              in rural states, while smaller territories like the Australian Capital Territory contribute
              minimally. Emissions are measured in million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (Mt CO₂-e), highlighting
              how energy-intensive industries continue to dominate Australia’s carbon footprint despite gradual
              improvements in renewable adoption.

            <p class="chart-caption">
              The temperature anomaly values show how much warmer or cooler each month was compared to the 2000–2023 average. 
              Positive values mean the month was hotter than usual, while negative values mean it was cooler. 
              Red dots on the chart represent warmer months, and blue dots show cooler ones. You can use the “Select Year” filter to view temperature anomalies for a specific year or choose “All” to see the overall trend. 
              Over time, the growing number of red dots highlights Australia’s clear warming trend since 2000. 
              Years such as 2013, 2019, and 2024 recorded some of the hottest months on record. This ongoing rise in temperature has increased the frequency of heatwaves, droughts, and extreme fire weather, intensifying bushfire risks. 
              The data reveals how climate change is reshaping Australia’s climate, making it hotter, drier, and more vulnerable to severe bushfires.

    <h2>Geographic Distribution of Bushfire Risk and Occurrence</h2>

        <p class="chart-caption">
          The Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), developed by Alan G. McArthur of the CSIRO in the 1960s, measures the potential severity of bushfire conditions based on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and drought levels. Higher FFDI values indicate more dangerous fire weather, reflecting increased ignition risk, faster spread, and greater difficulty in control. The index is divided into five key categories: High (12–25), Very High (25–50), Severe (50–75), Extreme (75–100), and Catastrophic (>100), each representing escalating levels of danger. Over the past few decades and into future projections, Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales have consistently recorded the highest FFDI levels, reflecting sustained exposure to intense heat and dry conditions. In contrast, Tasmania continues to record the lowest values due to its cooler, maritime climate and proximity to Antarctica. Overall, the data reveals a steady rise in fire danger across Australia, driven by increasing temperatures and prolonged drought.

          Each point represents a hotspot, with colour intensity indicating the level of surface heat. Users can adjust the Minimum Confidence (%) and Minimum Brightness controls to filter out weak or uncertain detections, refining the visualisation to highlight only significant fire events.
The 2016 Tasmanian fires burned over 100,000 hectares, including parts of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, while subsequent years saw widespread fires driven by drought and high fuel loads. The 2019–2020 Black Summer fires were among the most destructive in recorded history, burning nearly 24 million hectares, destroying over 3,000 homes, and killing or displacing an estimated three billion animals. In the following years, bushfires continued at a smaller scale, including events in New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania during the 2021–2022 season.

        <p class="chart-caption">
          Australia has experienced numerous devastating bushfires throughout its history, driven by its hot, dry climate and vast flammable landscapes. 
          The graph highlights the largest bushfires by area burned, including the 1974–75 Bushfire Season, which scorched over 117 million hectares, around 15 percent of the continent. 
          Other major events include the 1969–70 Dry River Victoria fire, 1968–69 Killarney Top Spring fire, and the 2002 Northern Territory bushfires, each consuming tens of millions of hectares. 
          The 2019–20 Black Summer also stands out for its extensive national impact. 
          These fires demonstrate Australia’s recurring exposure to extreme fire conditions across different regions and decades.
          Together, these events reveal how climate variability, land management practices, and natural fuel accumulation continue to shape the scale and intensity of Australia’s bushfire seasons.
