The dot map titled “Fire Hotspots Across Australia (2016–2021)” visualizes thermal anomaly detections from NASA’s VIIRS satellite system. Each dot represents a hotspot, an area of unusually high surface heat, and is color coded by brightness as shown in the legend. Users can adjust the minimum confidence and minimum brightness sliders to filter out weaker or uncertain detections, while tooltips display details such as date, time, confidence level, and fire radiative power.
Brighter dots indicate stronger fire activity, allowing users to distinguish between low intensity and high intensity events. Increasing the confidence threshold helps remove false positives caused by reflections or background heat. The map highlights clear spatial patterns of fire activity, with concentrations along the eastern seaboard, southeastern forests, and parts of Western Australia. These regions have faced recurring bushfires, including the 2019–2020 Black Summer season, one of the most destructive in Australian history. Overall, the map provides a clear visual summary of where fires occur, their intensity, and detection reliability, supporting broader analysis of climate, vegetation, and environmental impacts.
